# 5G Mining and MOBILE Rewards

Several factors contribute to how much `MOBILE` a 5G Hotspot will earn over a given period, there
are some higher level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in mind that will help better
explain what you might earn and why. This section covers these, as well as some mining and token
reward basics.

## How To Mine MOBILE

Mining MOBILE and providing 5G coverage requires a Helium 5G Hotspot and a compatible CBRS Small
Cell Radio. These components can be purchased as a bundle or separately. 5G Hotspots must be online
and registered in the SAS (Spectrum Access System) maintained by the FCC. Specific instructions can
be found during onboarding from individual 5G Hotspot Makers.

:::note

Once the 5G Hotspot is onboarded and Small Cell is physically installed and connected to the 5G
Hotspot, it should automatically appear in the Radio Dashboard on the local IP address.

5G Hotspots will appear on explorer.helium.com between 2-4 days, depending on how quickly it is
registered in the SAS.

:::

Install Helium Wallet app to manage HNT/Mobile token.

- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-Hotspot/id1450463605)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet&gl=US)

Once the 5G rewards are activated, and given correct installation, the 5G Hotspot will start earning
MOBILE automatically.

## Emissions Curve

There will be a max supply of 250B MOBILE with issuance halvenings of every 2 years aligned with the
HNT issuance halvenings. The first halving will occur on August 1, 2023 to align with HNT halving
and will continue on a 2 year cycle afterward.

This allocation is distributed throughout the shortened 1 year period to online 5G Hotspots on an
epochal basis, weighted by Small Cell model.

For clarity, the emission schedule is as follows:

| Year | MOBILE at the start of the year | MOBILE minted |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1    | 50B                             | 116B\*        |
| 2    | 116B                            | 33B           |
| 3    | 1495B                           | 33B           |
| 4    | 182B                            | 16.5B         |
| 5    | 198.5B                          | 16.5B         |
| 6    | 215B                            | 8.25B         |
| 7    | 223.25B                         | 8.25B         |

\*50B pre-mine, 66B emitted in year 1

## How Do Hotspots Earn Helium MOBILE Tokens?

The Helium blockchain rewards 5G Hotspots for providing 5G wireless coverage and verifying the
Helium Network. 5G Hotspots are rewarded in the Helium MOBILE Token.

During the Genesis Period, 5G Hotspots will earn MOBILE by reporting their status via a “heartbeat”,
an automatic process of reporting to the Blockchain that the Small Cell Radio is online and
registered with the SAS.

| Reward Type | Chain Variable | Description                                                             |
| :---------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heartbeat   | `UNKNOWN`      | Rewarded to any 5G Hotspot that maintains a valid connection to the SAS |

**_Do I Have To Actively Participate to Earn Rewards Once My 5G Hotspot is Deployed?_**

No. Once your 5G Hotspot is completely deployed and fully synced with the Helium blockchain, you as
the owner are not required to do anything else in order to earn MOBILE. Your 5G Hotspot will perform
all of the above activities on its own while it runs.

### Indoor Small Cells

These less powerful Small Cell Radios are ideal for indoor installations, such as coffee shops,
bars, grocery stores, etc. Indoor Small Cell Radios are generally easier to install and create a
shorter range, localized area of 5G coverage.

Indoor Small Cell Radios are physically smaller radios and can be installed at any height. It is not
recommended to install an Indoor Small Cell outdoors, as they are not weather resistant.

### Outdoor Small Cells

These Small Cell Radios are more Powerful than Indoor Small Cell Radios and are typically
weatherized to endure the elements. Outdoor Small Cell Radios create a larger area of 5G coverage
while requiring a bit more planning when installing and maintaining.

Outdoor Small Cells require installation above ground level and require registration with the
Spectrum Access System (SAS) to operate. Please be sure to evaluate your locations and ability to
install these Small Cell Radios, and consider hiring a professional to ensure your installation is
secure and meets all regulatory requirements.

SAS registration is expected to be completed within 24 hours of submission, Hosts will be contacted
via email with a rejection reply and an explanation of what needs to be corrected.
